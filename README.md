**Follow me as I journey through the amazing world of artificial intelligence and machine learning** 

## 1. Education.
- I graduated from IT-HÃ¶gskolan with a diploma in *Applikations Utvecklare till Android och iOS* in the summer of 2021. 
- Currently pursuing a diploma in *Artificial Intelligence and machine learning*.

## 2. Work Experience.
- I did my internship at itiden for a period of 16 weeks where i mostly worked a frontend developer using typescript and javascript. I gained a wide experience and got a chnace to put to into use the theoritical knowledge that i gathered from school.
- I currently work at dagab while I pursue my studies to become the best programmer I have always aspired to become.

## 3. Why AI and Machine Learning.
- Until August 2019, I had never seen a line of code. Programming looked like the 0s and 1s from the matrix movie. I struggled to catch up but eventually got better especially after my LIA2 at itiden. But, I want more! I believe I can get more. The fascination about programming is there's always more., <more knowledge to grasp>
- I think if we let computers do some of the boring and repetitive things we do everyday, bet it at work or home, life will be better for everyone.
