**Follow me as I journey through the amazing world of artificial intelligence and machine learning** 

## 1. Education.

- > I graduated from IT-HÃ¶gskolan with a diploma in *Applikations Utvecklare till Android och iOS* in the summer of 2021. 

- > Currently pursuing a diploma in *Artificial Intelligence and machine learning*.

## 2. Work Experience.

- > I did my internship at itiden for a period of 16 weeks where i mostly worked a frontend developer using typescript and javascript. I gained a wide experience and got a chance to put to into practice the theoritical knowledge that i gathered from school. I also learned how to work in a team in real life situation as well as occassionally work independently.


- > I currently work at dagab while I pursue my studies to become the best programmer I have always aspired to become.

## 3. Why AI and Machine Learning.

- > Until August 2019, I had never seen a line of code. Programming looked like the 0s and 1s from the matrix movie. I struggled to catch up but eventually got better especially after my LIA2 at itiden. But, I want more! I believe I can get more. The fascinating aspect about programming is there's always more to learn.

- > I see a sweet spot between the intersection of my knowledge in web and application development and data driven technologies like AI and machine learning.

- > AI use in predictive analysis, healthcare, automation to name a few, offers an enormous potential to continuously transform our society and I am keen to contribute in this transformation.
